In this section, you will compile a financial report to demo your calculations to the consumer app team. The report should be written as a markdown file and include the following sections:

*** Budget Analysis: ***
In the past 90 days the top spending categories are transfers at about $20000, payments at about $6000, and food and drink at about $3000. The spending per month is about $10,500 on average. The third month had the highest spending at $11145. Based on an income analysis, the clients income last year was $6000 and their projected income is $6085. The monthly income is $500. Not sure how this client is able to spend so much when the annual income is so low. The budget analysis is showing they spend much more than they can afford to.
*** Retirement Planning: ***
A portfolio with 60% SPY and 40% AGG was analyzed for the client over a 30 year time span with a Monte Carlo simulation. The client was assumed to only be able to invest $20000 to start in the portfolio.

This specific retirement portfolio is not adequate at the 10th percentile at 30 years to provide for the expected annual income of $6805 with a withdraw of 4% from the portfolio.

The expected return at the 90th percentile for the initial investment of $20000 in the portfolio over the next 252 * 30 trading days is $26067.25. The expected return at the 50th percentile for the initial investment of $20000 in the portfolio over the next 252 * 30 trading days is $20972.91. The expected return at the 10th percentile for the initial investment of $20000 in the portfolio over the next 252 * 30 trading days is $20134.35. 

A 4% withdraw rate from the 10th percentile retirement portfolio is $805.3741264875301 at 30 years. This value is lower than the projected yearly income of $6085. This means that for the 10th percentile value the withdraw from the portfolio will not meet and will not exceed the value of the projected annual income. This portfolio will not provide adequate retirement income at that withdrawl rate to meet current annual income/living expectations.

For a 50% higher initial investment of $30000.00 in the portfolio over the next 252 * 30 trading days the 10th percentile net value is $30201.529743282383

A 4% withdraw rate from the retirement portfolio for the 10th percentile will be $1208.0611897312954. This value is still lower than the projected yearly income of $6085. This means that the withdraw from the portfolio will not meet and will not exceed the value of the projected annual income. Even with more initial investment, this portfolio will not provide adequate retirement income at that withdrawl rate to meet current annual income/living expectations.

It is recommended to the client to reduce spending as save more to invest in their portfolio. Additionally, it is recommend that the client elect to change their portfolio investment stocks in order to obtain a better return. As even for the 90th percentile, the client will only earn about $6000 on their initial investment which is only equivalent to one year of this clients current income.
